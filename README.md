# Relacade / Hello World

## [Visit](https://github.com/Meowmeowzers/Relacade)
A prototype program for procedurally generating tile based game levels in Unity using a modified WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm.

## Notes
- Made with Unity Engine.
- No rotations. Simple constraints setup but higher complexity when a lot of input tiles exist.

## TODO
- Non-local constraints
- Global constraints
- Import/Export data
- Constraint setup UI
